rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select lucsys_lsr300mini_description
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch lucsys_lsr300mini_description display.launch.py
```

Select a configuration with `model:=<configuration>`. Use `gui:=false` for the non-interactive joint-state publisher, `rviz:=false` to disable RViz, and `use_sim_time:=true` only when a simulation clock is available.
